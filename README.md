# EnterpriseApp

It is a simple baseline code to start enterprise big applications with a solid structure.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.3.

## Development server

Prepare the ui library `npm run ui:build`
To see the example app run `npm run start:example`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Code scaffolding

We recommend the use of: [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/cli/console) if you use vscode you can find [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console).

## Build

You are free to prepare your own build, and we recommend the use of: [buildkite](https://buildkite.com/)

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

For this moment we only have one component in our library so this boilerplate is a working in progress...More news coming soon!
